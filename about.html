    <h2>General Information</h2>
    <p>
      The Mighty Ducks Hockey League was established in 1996 to provide athletes
      residing in Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn
      and play hockey. To be a member of MDHL, you must be between the ages of 4 -
      12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL is run by a small
      full-time staff and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and
      previous league members.
